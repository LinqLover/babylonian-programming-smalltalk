Deserializes a Method Test to an Example.

Can only deserialize methods generated by the BPMethodTestSerializer.
Test must have following structure:

`
testExampleName

	self assert: (expected value) equals: ((receiver code) methodToTest: arg1 and: arg2 ...)
`

- Single statement
- assert:equals: is is first selector, method-under-test is second
- arbitrary many arguments
