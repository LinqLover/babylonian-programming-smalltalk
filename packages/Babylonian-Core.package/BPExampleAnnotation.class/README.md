The example annotation is a placeholder for the actual example object. This placeholder is used for the conversion cycle between TextAttributes and source code annotations. Their lifetime is rather short and rather act as an Adapter put in place by the BPExamplesAnnotation.

If you want to do something with the example use #actualExample which is a BPExample.
